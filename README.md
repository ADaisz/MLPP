# ML++

Machine learning is a vast and exiciting discipline, garnering attention from specialists of many fields. Unfortunately, for C++ programmers and enthusiasts, there appears to be a lack of support for this magnificient language in the field of machine learning. As a consequence, this library was created in order to fill that void and give C++ a true foothold in the ML sphere to act as a crossroad between low level developers and machine learning engineers.
